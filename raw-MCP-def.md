Okay, let's break down the Model-Context-Protocol (MCP). Since it's a relatively new concept and standard, information might still be evolving, but we can outline the core ideas based on its purpose and known implementations like its compatibility with Claude Desktop.

As of **April 5, 2025**, here's a theoretical understanding of MCP:

**1. What is MCP (Model-Context-Protocol)?**

MCP is a specification or protocol designed to **standardize the communication** between AI Language Models (like those powering Claude) and external resources. These resources primarily fall into two categories:

*   **Tools:** External services or functions that the AI model can invoke to perform actions or get specific information (e.g., a calculator, a web search API, a code execution environment, or your desired markdown note manager).
*   **Context Sources:** Providers of relevant information or data that the AI model can use to inform its responses, but which aren't necessarily "actions" to be executed (e.g., accessing local files, databases, knowledge bases, or real-time data feeds). Often, the line between a "tool" and a "context source" can blur, as a tool might be used *to retrieve* context.

**The core goal of MCP is decoupling:**

*   It allows the **LLM Host** (the application or backend running/serving the AI model) to interact with various tools and context sources without needing to know the specific implementation details of each one.
*   It allows **Tool/Context developers** to create services that can be used by any MCP-compatible LLM Host without writing custom integrations for each one.

Think of it like USB for AI tools: any MCP-compatible tool can potentially plug into any MCP-compatible AI host via an MCP Server.

**2. Key Components, Sub-components, and Terms**

Let's visualize the ecosystem and define the parts:

```
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-----------------+       +-----------+
| User /            | ----> | LLM Host /        | ----> | MCP Server      | ----> | Tool /    |
| Host Client       |       | Host Application  |       | (Implements MCP)|       | Context   |
| (e.g., Claude     | <---- | (e.g., Claude     | <---- |                 | <---- | Source    |
| Desktop)          |       | Backend Service)  |       |                 |       | (e.g., .md|
+-------------------+       +-------------------+       +-----------------+       | notes API)|
                                     ^                                            +-----------+
                                     |
                                     v
                             +-----------------+
                             | Large Language  |
                             | Model (LLM)     |
                             +-----------------+
```

*   **LLM Host Client (e.g., Claude Desktop):**
    *   This is the user-facing application. It interacts with the user and communicates with the LLM Host (often a backend service).
    *   It *might* be configured to tell the LLM Host *which* MCP Server to use.

*   **LLM Host (or Host Application):**
    *   This is the core application or backend service that *hosts* the LLM.
    *   It manages the interaction with the LLM itself (sending prompts, receiving responses).
    *   Crucially, it acts as the **MCP Client**. It speaks the Model-Context-Protocol to communicate with the MCP Server.
    *   It receives the user's request (potentially via the Host Client), processes it with the LLM, and when the LLM decides to use a tool or needs context, the Host initiates communication with the MCP Server.

*   **MCP Server:**
    *   This is the central piece you want to build. It acts as an **intermediary or broker**.
    *   **Role:** It implements the server-side of the Model-Context-Protocol. It listens for requests from the LLM Host.
    *   **Core Functionality:**
        *   **Discovery:** It tells the LLM Host what tools and context sources it provides. This usually involves sending a manifest or schema describing available capabilities, including names, descriptions (for the LLM to understand), and input/output parameters.
        *   **Invocation/Execution:** It receives requests from the LLM Host to execute a specific tool or retrieve context.
        *   **Routing/Dispatching:** It maps the incoming request (e.g., "use the `markdown_note_creator` tool") to the actual implementation of that tool.
        *   **Communication with Tools:** It interacts with the actual backend logic or external APIs of the tools/context sources it manages.
        *   **Response Handling:** It takes the result from the tool/context source, formats it according to the MCP specification, and sends it back to the LLM Host.
    *   **Internal Components (Conceptual):**
        *   **Protocol Listener:** Listens for incoming HTTP/WebSocket/other connections from LLM Hosts.
        *   **Request Parser:** Understands the MCP message formats (e.g., JSON payloads for discovery or invocation).
        *   **Service Registry/Manifest Generator:** Keeps track of available tools/context sources and generates the discovery information.
        *   **Tool/Context Connectors/Adapters:** These are the specific pieces of code *you* would write within your MCP server. Each connector knows how to talk to a particular tool or context source (e.g., one connector for your markdown notes, another for a calculator, etc.). This is where the actual logic for interacting with your `.md` files would reside.
        *   **Response Formatter:** Packages the results from the connectors into the MCP response format.

*   **Tools / Context Sources:**
    *   These are the actual backend services, functions, APIs, or data stores that perform actions or provide information.
    *   In your case, the "Tool" would be the logic you write (likely as part of your MCP Server's "Tool Connector") to create, read, update, and delete markdown files on your system. It's the *implementation* that the MCP Server calls.

**Important Terms (within the MCP Protocol likely):**

*   **`mcp_discover` (or similar):** A message type sent *from* the LLM Host *to* the MCP Server, asking "What capabilities do you have?".
*   **Tool Manifest / Schema:** The response *from* the MCP Server to a discovery request. It describes the tools (name, description for the LLM, input parameters, output format). This is crucial for the LLM to know *how* to ask for a tool to be used.
*   **`mcp_tool_invoke` / `mcp_execute` (or similar):** A message type sent *from* the LLM Host *to* the MCP Server, asking it to run a specific tool with specific arguments (e.g., "Run `markdown_note_creator` with `title='Meeting Notes'` and `content='...'`).
*   **Tool Result / Context Data:** The response *from* the MCP Server *to* the LLM Host, containing the output of the tool execution or the requested context information.

**3. How it Connects LLM Host and Tools**

The MCP Server acts as the standardized bridge:

1.  **Connection & Discovery:** The LLM Host connects to the configured MCP Server's endpoint. It sends a discovery request.
2.  **Capability Advertising:** The MCP Server responds with the manifest of available tools (like your `.md` note manager), describing what they do and how to call them.
3.  **LLM Decides to Use Tool:** During a conversation, the LLM (guided by the Host) determines it needs to use a tool based on the user's request and the tool descriptions it received during discovery.
4.  **Invocation Request:** The LLM Host constructs a tool invocation request according to the MCP format (specifying the tool name and arguments) and sends it to the MCP Server.
5.  **Server Executes Tool:** The MCP Server receives the request, identifies the target tool (`.md` note manager), calls the corresponding internal connector/adapter function with the provided arguments.
6.  **Tool Logic Runs:** Your custom code for managing `.md` files executes (e.g., creates a new file, appends text, searches notes).
7.  **Result Return:** The tool logic returns its result (e.g., "Note created successfully at path X", or the content of a found note) back to the MCP Server's connector.
8.  **Response to Host:** The MCP Server formats this result into the MCP response format and sends it back to the LLM Host.
9.  **LLM Uses Result:** The LLM Host receives the result and incorporates it into the ongoing process, potentially using it to formulate the final response to the user.

**4. Building Your MCP Server and Tool**

Based on the above, here’s the conceptual path using an SDK (like the TS or Python ones you mentioned):

1.  **Set up MCP Server Project:** Use the chosen SDK to create a basic MCP server application. This will likely involve setting up an HTTP or WebSocket server that listens on a specific port.
2.  **Implement Discovery:** Configure the server to respond to discovery requests. This involves defining your `.md` note tool(s) – giving them names, descriptions (crucial for the LLM!), and defining expected input arguments (e.g., `filename`, `content`, `search_query`) and output format.
3.  **Implement Tool Connector Logic:** Write the actual functions within your server project that handle the logic for your markdown notes tool. This code will interact with the file system (using standard Node.js `fs` or Python `os`/`pathlib` modules) to perform actions like:
    *   Creating a new note (`create_note(filename, content)`)
    *   Appending to a note (`append_to_note(filename, text)`)
    *   Reading a note (`read_note(filename)`)
    *   Searching notes (`search_notes(query)`)
    *   Listing notes (`list_notes()`)
4.  **Implement Invocation Handling:** Write the code in your MCP server that listens for tool invocation requests. When a request for your `.md` tool comes in, parse the arguments and call the appropriate connector function you wrote in step 3.
5.  **Handle Results:** Take the return value from your connector function (e.g., success message, file content, list of files) and package it into the MCP response format to send back to the LLM Host.
6.  **Run the Server:** Start your MCP server process.
7.  **Configure Host Client:** Configure Claude Desktop (or another compatible client/host) to point to the address and port where your MCP server is running (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
8.  **Test:** Interact with Claude Desktop. Try prompts that should trigger your tool, like "Create a new note titled 'Shopping List' with the content 'Milk, Eggs, Bread'" or "Find my notes mentioning 'MCP'". Observe if Claude attempts to use the tool via your server.

This theoretical understanding should give you a solid foundation. The SDKs will provide the specific functions and structures to implement the protocol messages (discovery, invocation, response) and help you structure the tool connector logic. Good luck with building your MCP server and `.md` note tool!
